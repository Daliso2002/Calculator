A basic calculator application built with Java Swing, implementing an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is designed to demonstrate GUI development and basic arithmetic parsing in Java.

Features
User-friendly interface with buttons for numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and additional functions such as clear (C) and equals (=).
Arithmetic parsing using a custom-built evaluator with operator precedence, allowing for accurate calculation without reliance on ScriptEngine.
Error handling for common issues like division by zero and invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Technologies Used
Java Swing for GUI components and layout.
Stacks for expression evaluation to handle operator precedence and basic parsing without external libraries.

How to Use
Download or Clone the repository.
Compile and run GUICalculator.java in any Java-supported IDE or from the command line.
Enter numbers and click operators to build an equation.
Press "=" to compute and display the result.
Use "C" to clear the display and start a new calculation.
